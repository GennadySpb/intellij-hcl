## Issues

### Issue Reporting Checklists

All kinds of issues are welcomed here, including feature requests, bug reports, and
general questions.

#### Bug Reports

 - [ ] __Test against latest version__: Make sure you are using the latest
   released plugin version, as some bug may be already fixed in latest version.

 - [ ] __Search for possible duplicate reports__

 - [ ] __Include steps to reproduce__: Provide steps to reproduce the issue,
   along with your problematic `.tf` files, with secrets removed, so we can try to
   reproduce it. Without this, it makes it much harder to fix the issue.

 - [ ] __For exceptions, post them as code block or gist__: If you experienced an exception, 
   please post it as code block or create a [gist](https://gist.github.com). 
   Double check no sensitive items were in the log.

#### Feature Requests

 - [ ] __Test against latest version__: Make sure you are using the latest
   released plugin version, as some feature could be already implemented.

 - [ ] __Search for possible duplicate requests__
 
 - [ ] __Include a use case description__: In addition to describing the
   behavior of the feature you'd like to see added, it's helpful to also lay
   out the reason why the feature would be important and how it would benefit
   plugin users.

#### Questions

 - [ ] __Just ask them__


## Pull Requests

Thank you for contributing! Here you'll find information on what to include in
your Pull Request to ensure it is accepted quickly.
 
 * Ensure your branch is rebased on top of `master`
 * Squash/Fixup some commits to have quite good git history
 * It's better to have one 'complete' piece of work done - one commit. 
 That would simplify review process 
 * Tests are highly recommended for any added/changed code
 * If you have questions about plugin internals you're free to contact me on email 
 or other communication channels
